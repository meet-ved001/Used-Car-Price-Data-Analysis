# Used-Car-Price-Data-Analysis
My project, "Used Car Price Analysis," integrates data cleaning, transformation, normalization, visualization, and model generation to provide comprehensive insights into the dynamics of pre-owned vehicle pricing.
Commencing with meticulous data cleaning procedures to ensure dataset integrity, I subsequently employed transformation techniques to engineer features for enhanced predictive accuracy. Normalization was employed to standardize numerical attributes, while visualization facilitated the discovery of underlying patterns and correlations. Leveraging linear regression, random forest, and decision tree algorithms, our models are trained and fine-tuned to predict used car prices accurately. Through this cohesive approach, my project aims to offer valuable guidance to stakeholders navigating the complexities of the used car market, facilitating informed decision-making processes.
